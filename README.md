## Running TRGAted as a Local Session

While it is possible to host the server "back end" somewhere
so that users only need to point their web browser to a link,
it is also possible to launch both the back and front "ends" on your local machine.
The server back end will be an R session on your own machine,
while the front end is your web browser,
pointed to the appropriate local URL.

Make sure that you first have installed [the latest version of R](http://cran.r-project.org/). 

Download repository and open .R file in R Studio. launch TRGAted App. 

TRGAted relies on the following packages, which should be installed if running the code locally.

```r
install.packages("shiny") 
install.packages("ggplots2")
install.packages("broom")
install.packages("survMisc")
install.packages("survminer")
install.packages("shinythemes")
install.packages("DT")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggrepel")
install.packages("reshape2")
